* BFD:
  + New executable formats
  + Read list of libraries needed
  + Read list of undefined symbols in executables
  + Read list of exported symbols in libraries
  + Read debugging info from executables/libraries
* Update list of syscalls automatically?
* Improve documentation
* Improve -e option
* Improce -l option
* Improve C++ name demangling
* Display different argument types:
  + how to display execl...?
  + format+: for scanf()...: display args as pointers, and imply `+' for args
* Update /etc/ltrace.conf
* netscape:
  + Why does it show so many `breakpointed at:' messages?
    \- Is this still true?
* Option -T (print time spent in each libcall)
* Option -c (summary)
* More architectures: sparc, alpha
* More operating systems (solaris?)
* Option -I (inter-library calls)
* Modify ARGTYPE_STRING[0-5] types so that they not stop displaying chars when '\0' is encountered
* Version number guessing does no longer work with autoconf :-(
