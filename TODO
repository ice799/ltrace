* BFD:
  + New executable formats
  + Read list of libraries needed
  + Read list of undefined symbols in executables
  + Read list of exported symbols in libraries
  + Read debugging info from executables/libraries
* Automatically update list of syscalls?
* Improve documentation
* Improve -e/-x options (regexp?)
* Improve -l option
* Improve C++ name demangling
* Display different argument types
* Update /etc/ltrace.conf
* More architectures, cleaner way to port
* More operating systems (solaris?)
* Option -I (inter-library calls)
* Modify ARGTYPE_STRING[0-5] types so that they don't stop displaying chars when '\0' is seen
* Get rid of EVENT_ARCH_SYSCALL and EVENT_ARCH_SYSRET
* Cleaner way to use breakpoints:
  + BP is placed in the PLT
  + When control hits there:
    - write down return address
    - change return address with another one (handled by ltrace)
    - get arguments...
    - change the process' PC to be in the correct place,
      without removing breakpoint
  + When control hits one of our return addresses:
    - get return value...
    - change PC to the right place
* To be able to work with processes sharing memory, we must:
  + ptrace() every single thread
  + place breakpoints only in places where the process control can continue
    without having to remove it
* Get rid of GNU's autoconf stuff
* List source dependencies in Makefile
* Create different ltrace processes to trace different children
* debug: change "-d" option to be something like "-d elf,events", or "-d breakpoints"
* Find out if a process is sharing memory with its parent?
* When using -p, find out if that process is sharing memory with other procs
