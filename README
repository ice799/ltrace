1. Introduction
---------------

ltrace is a debugging tool, similar to strace, but it traces library
calls instead of system calls.

2. Where can I find it
----------------------

http://ltrace.alioth.debian.org

3. How does it work
-------------------

Using software breakpoints, just like gdb.

4. Where does it work
---------------------

It works with ELF based Linux systems running on i386, m68k, S/390,
ARM, PowerPC, PowerPC64, IA64, AMD64, SPARC and Alpha processors.

It is part of at least Debian GNU/Linux, RedHat, SuSE and Mandrake.

5. Bugs
-------

Too many to list here :).  If you like to submit a bug report, or a
feature request, either do that against the Debian `ltrace' package,
or mail ltrace-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.

This file is very incomplete and out-of-date.
