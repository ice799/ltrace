1. Introduction
---------------
ltrace is a debugging tool, similar to strace, but it traces library
calls instead of system calls.

2. How does it work
-------------------
Using i386 software breakpoints, just like gdb.

3. Where does it work
---------------------
At the time of writting, it works only with Intel ELF executables. It
has been used only in Debian/GNU Linux, but it should work without any
problem in any other i386 Linux, such as SuSe or RedHat, and maybe in
other i386 based POSIX system, such as Hurd or *BSD.
